            <p>DXT is just a group of kids trying to make being healthy easy and accessible to everybody, no matter the schedule. We think helping people with health in a little cost way would benefit the lives of many and keep the population healthy. If we can do it, so can you with just 2 hours of your time every single day. If you put the time and effort into working out with the big DXT community, you can help us by using our promo code in the promo tabs at checkouts. Using that can help us make more improvements to the website and community.</p>
